### The Beginning
I remember first time I decided to use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/). It was 2020 when I was studying at a [bootcamp](https://www.hacktiv8.com/) in Jakarta. It was because one of my instructor use it during our class.

_And damn he looks so cool..._

I code everyday during my time at bootcamp. It was so intense until I feel it is not so efficient to move around my code using mouse.
And I started to like the idea on maximizing efficiency by omiting mouse and using keyboard to move around.
So yeah, I'm using Vim until now.

### Re-interpretation
TBH using Vim with several plugins is enough for me. But it would be great if Vim can help me during coding something.
Using old configuration, I never utilize LSP. So I decided to use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), Vim but more modern.  
But customizing Neovim is really time consuming. It is because the nature of Neovim that can be fully customize according to everyone needs.

_This is modern day, there should be something that can make my life easier..._

Turn out, there is a lot of starter template, easy to install, fire and go, fully customize with sane config Neovim configs.  
Here is some starter templates that I found :

- [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
- [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
- [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/)
- [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/)
- [CosmicNvim](https://cosmicnvim.vercel.app/)
- [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/)

Pick your poison but I choose [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) because it have minimal plugins to get me run.  
After I spent my 2 days to customize kickstart.nvim, it's finally done. You could [check this link](https://github.com/didadadida93/kickstart.nvim) to see my configuration. Here is a sneek peek on how it looks.
