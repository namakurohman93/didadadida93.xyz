### How I do it
I believe everyone have their own way to serve multiple website using only single VPS.
As for me, I use [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) as reverse proxy, so I can redirect incoming request to my localhost. I follow [this nginx.conf](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/) configuration and change it as needed. Using the same configuration, I can setup several server blocks so I have several hosts on a single server.

```nginx title=nginx.conf
http {
      # omitted for brevity

      server {
            listen          80;
            server_name     yourdomain.com;

            location / {
                proxy_pass    http://127.0.0.1:5555   # your localhost
            }
      }

      server {
            listen          80;
            server_name     yourseconddomain.com;

            location / {
                proxy_pass    http://127.0.0.1:6666   # your second localhost
            }
      }
}
```

Next is you need to setup your DNS management to point your domain to the same VPS and voila, you done.
