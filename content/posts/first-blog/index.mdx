Hello everyone, this is my first blog. This web page is built by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) using [LekoArts - Gatsby Theme Minimal Blog](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/examples/minimal-blog) starter.

### So why use Gatsby?
First of all, before I start to create my own web page, I was thinking about which framework to be use. There are several frameworks that I have used before such as [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). But if I use those frameworks I need to build components from the ground up. I need to think about state of every components, and the most important is I need to _styling_ the components.

_I admit I'm suck at styling web page..._

Despite I'm suck at styling web page, I want my web page to **look great** so I start researching for framework that at least have default styles. Then I found [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and it have what is called "starters". "Starters" are a boilerplate [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) sites maintained by the community and intended for jump-starting development quickly. It have default config such as typography, styles, etc. I'm trying a lot of starters from [Gatsby starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/?v=2) and finally I choose [Gatsby Starter Minimal Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog/) by [LekoArts](https://www.lekoarts.de/en).

[Gatsby Starter Minimal Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog/) is a great starter. It have features 

* MDX
* **Fully Customize**
* **Light Mode / Dark Mode**
* **Typography driven, minimal style**
* Tags/Categories support
* Code Hightlighting
* RSS Feed for blog posts
* Google Analytics Support
* SEO
* Offile Support & WebApp Manifest

The features that I bold is my favorites. So even tho I use [Gatsby Starter Minimal Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog/) starter, I can customize it. Furthemore it have Light / Dark Mode and it have minimalistic style.
