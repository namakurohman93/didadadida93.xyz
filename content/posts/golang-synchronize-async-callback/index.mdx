Worked on Golang project. The requirements were to interact with dll interop from C++ code.

### Interop
Interop stands for interoperability, which refers to the ability of different programming languages or systems to work together and communicate effectively.
So the system already there and one way to interact with it is through interop dll file.

### C++ Function Signature
In order to work with dll interop, they gave me a documentation of the dll's interop function signature.

> While working on this project I found dealing with function signature involves an object will be trickier.

As such, I would recomend to ask your senior developer to **make function signature using simple data type** such as `integer` and `string`.

### Mechanism
To interact with dll interop, the integration was designed around a **callback function**.
Instead of directly calling dll interop function repeatedly to fetch data, the dll interop was built to **push data** whenever new data was available.
This is classic pattern often used in real-time systems or event-driven architectures.

The callback function received a JSON string which then need to be parsed and processed.  
But first the received argument need to be converted into Go string.

> I'd like to convert the argument as quickly as possible and passed all the heavy process
(parse it into Go object, insert it into database) into goroutine.

### Synchronizing
The fact that I want to pass all the heavy process into goroutine and I dont know for sure when or how many callbacks get fired,
synchronizing all goroutines will be a challenge.

##### WaitGroup
WaitGroup is more suitable for this case.

> I dont know when or how many goroutines will be, but I'm sure I want to wait all of them to finish.

### Code
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"syscall"
	"unsafe"

	"golang.org/x/sys/windows"
)

var wg sync.WaitGroup

type DLLInterop struct {
	handle windows.Handle
}

func (d DLLInterop) getProcAddress(procname string) uintptr {
	addr, err := windows.GetProcAddress(d.handle, procname)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	return addr
}

func (d DLLInterop) FreeLibrary() {
	windows.FreeLibrary(d.handle)
}

func (d DLLInterop) StartRequestData() uintptr {
	return d.getProcAddress("StartRequestData")
}

func (d DLLInterop) RegisterCallback() uintptr {
	return d.getProcAddress("RegisterCallback")
}

func NewInterop() DLLInterop {
	handle, err := windows.LoadLibrary("/usr/libs/dlldummy.dll")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	return DLLInterop{handle}
}

func Callback(ret uintptr) uintptr {
	if cStr := (*byte)(unsafe.Pointer(ret)); cStr != nil {
		// increase WaitGroup so we can track how much
		// goroutine has started
		wg.Add(1)
		go ProcessJson(windows.BytePtrToString(cStr))
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Failed to process return pointer from callback")
	}
	return 0
}

func ProcessJson(json string) {
	// a heavy processes to convert json string
	// and insert it into database
	// etc..

	// when all the heavy processes are done,
	// call wg.Done() so main function know it's done
	defer wg.Done()
}

func main() {
	var interop DLLInterop = NewInterop()
	defer interop.FreeLibrary()

	// register callback to dll interop
	callbackPtr := syscall.NewCallback(Callback)
	syscall.SyscallN(uintptr(interop.RegisterCallback()), uintptr(callbackPtr))

	// start request data and it is blocking
	// at somepoint it will stop and we dont know when
	// and when it stop we dont know if there are still goroutine out there
	syscall.SyscallN(uintptr(interop.StartRequestData()))

	// when it reach here it mean StartRequest has stopped
	// wait for all goroutine to be done before closing main goroutine
	wg.Wait()
}
```
